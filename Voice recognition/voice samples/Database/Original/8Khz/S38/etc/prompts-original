vf5-16 For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap
vf5-17 She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled
vf5-18 Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated
vf5-19 Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said
vf5-20 If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed
vf5-21 So cheer up, and give us your paw
vf5-22 This time he did not yap for mercy
vf5-23 And the air was growing chilly
vf5-25 The questions may have come vaguely in his mind
vf5-27 Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine
vf5-28 Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass
vf5-31 For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
vf5-32 He did not rush in
vf5-33 It was edged with ice
vf5-34 He drank of the water cautiously
vf5-35 But a strange thing happened
vf5-36 He began to follow the footprints of the dog
vf5-37 Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose
vf5-38 Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions
vf5-40 He leapt again, and the club caught him once more

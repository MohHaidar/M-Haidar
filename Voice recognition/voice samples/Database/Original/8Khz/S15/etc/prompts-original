vf5-21 So cheer up, and give us your paw
vf5-22 This time he did not yap for mercy
vf5-23 And the air was growing chilly
vf5-24 Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two
vf5-25 The questions may have come vaguely in his mind
vf5-26 Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl
vf5-27 Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine
vf5-28 Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass
vf5-29 The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying
vf5-30 Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent
vf5-31 For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone
vf5-32 He did not rush in
vf5-33 It was edged with ice
vf5-34 He drank of the water cautiously
vf5-35 But a strange thing happened
vf5-36 He began to follow the footprints of the dog
vf5-37 Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose
vf5-38 Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions
vf5-39 Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day
vf5-40 He leapt again, and the club caught him once more

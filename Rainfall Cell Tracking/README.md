Deep learning models to test the fitness of our data, 
the models are based on Convolutional layers and LSTM.

The goal of the project is to predict the next frame 
from a time based sequence of rainfall maps.

The folder contains Google Colab notebooks, they are intended to be opened in the Colab envirenment.
The Code is written in Python3.6 and using the TensorFlow 2.x library.

The networks contain different architectures, some of then worked on the dataset and some of them  seem to not have an interesting result.

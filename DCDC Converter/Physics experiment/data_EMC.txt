in the file DATA_EMC.mat you find the following:
- PPx_U40_1000 is the x coordinate of the pivot point at the wind speed 4 m/s with a load of 1000 ohm
- PPy_U40_1000 is the y coordinate, th_U40_1000 is the angle of the wing
-TEx_U40_1000 and TEy_U40_1000 are the x,y coordinates of the trailing edge (the end of the wing)
- P is matrix [6 9] where along the rows is the load and along the column is the wind speed
- Up is a vector of the wind speed
- R is a vector of the load
- freq is a matrix [6 6] of the frequency. along the rows is the load, along the column is the wind speed (!! with the vector U !!)
- phases is a matrix [6 6] of the phase between the pivot point and the angle
- dt is the time interval, then the time of the experiment is: 
t = dt * [0:length(PPy_U65_5000)-1]
